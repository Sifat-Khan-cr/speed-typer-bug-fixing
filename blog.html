                <div class="accordion-body">What Is Session Storage?
                    A browsing session approximates your use of a website. If you visit a site, browse around for a bit,
                    then turn off your computer, you can think of that time as a single session. Your browser
                    configuration may change this in subtle ways, but a session aims to represent the chunk of time you
                    interact with a site.


                    What Is Local Storage?
                    Local storage maintains data across all instances of a site, whether they're in different tabs or
                    windows. It is also permanent, so the data won't disappear when you close your browser.


                    When you open a website that previously used local storage, it will always have access to that
                    stored data.

                    As a web developer, you can use this mechanism to retain data about a user. Some websites might use
                    this to keep you logged in or provide a more personalized experience.

                <div class="accordion-body">Local Scope
                    If you were to define some variables inside curly brackets {} or inside a specific function then
                    those variables are called local variables The local variables have a very confined scope which is
                    called the local scope But, with the release of ES6, the local scope was further broken down into
                    two different scopes:


                    Block Scope
                    Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                    variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                    statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
                    curly brackets {}.

                    What does it actually mean when we say JavaScript is single threaded?

                    It means that the main thread where JavaScript code is run, runs in one line at a time manner and
                    there is no possibility of running code in parallel.
